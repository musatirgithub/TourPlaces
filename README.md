<h3>Hi there âœ‹. In this project, I've designed a Tour Places page. For this purpose;</h3>
<ul>
  <li>First of all this is a react project,</li>
  <li>I've received data from a file,</li>
  <li>I've used components to construct the project,</li>
  <li>For passing the data between components I've used props,</li>
  <li>For styling I've used SASS/SCSS</li>
  <li>Gif image of the project is below. ðŸ‘‡ Hope you like the project! </li>
</ul>
